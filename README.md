# Robot-Guitar-Arduino
The device is a robot that can play a fully automated acustic guitar.  The commands are transmitted by an android smartphone,that by the means of a terminal Bluetooth send the code to Arduino, this code corresponds to the song to perform. Arduino decodes the received code and processes the program corresponding to one of the tasks stored in memory, providing the actuators (motor steppers and servomotors) the necessary instructions for the correct function of the robot. The guitar is placed horizontally on a smooth and regular surface where all the handcrafted supports are to support the various actuators.
